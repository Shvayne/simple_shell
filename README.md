# SIMPLE_SHELL
This is a collaborative project between Gbolahan Oyeniyi and Christiana Apinoko, aimed at creating a functional Unix shell implementation that provides 
users with a command-line interface for interacting with their computer system.

FEATURES
The Unix shell implementation provides the following features:

1. A command line interface for executing system commands
2. Support for built-in commands, such as cd, exit, and help
3. Environment variable management
4. Input/output redirection
5. Pipeline support
6. Command history and editing
7. File management utilities

REQUIREMENTS
The Unix shell implementation requires the following:

1. Linux operating system
2. GCC compiler
3. C programming language
